SKYRADAR-STCA-041: Suppression of STCA conflicts due to NTZ processing
SSS: ATCS-SSS-REQ-005855
Derived status partially
Derived rationale Alert inhibition on approach with NOZ and NTZ Areas
Safety impact false
Verification method Test
Verification level RL
(SDS rules HLR_10) [cmats_snp] Partial derivation shall be avoided
SKYRADAR shall flag STCA conflicts as suppressed for tracks located in NOZ if:
• The associated NTZ area is active, and
• The status of the NTZ areas manager is equal to OPERATIONAL, and
• The heading gap between each aircraft and the runway axis is lower than CSP: MAX_DELTA_HEADING, and
• The current distance between the aircraft is kept above VSP: MinimalDistance known as safety distance, and
• Each track is located within a different NOZ associated with an offline defined "parallel approach pair" of
runways, and
• The "parallel approach pair" is in INDEPENDENT mode, and
• The flag STCA_PARALLEL_APP_FPL_CHECK_FLAG is set to false or the runway of each track's coupled
FPL (if assigned) matches the runway linked to the NOZ where the track is located.

SKYRADAR-MSAW-025: Generation of Minimum Safe Altitude Warning alerts
SSS: ATCS-SSS-REQ-006142
Derived status partially
Derived rationale Terrain clearance monitoring for approach and departure operations
Safety impact true
Verification method Test
Verification level RL
(SDS rules HLR_15) [cmats_snp] Partial derivation shall be avoided
SKYRADAR shall generate MSAW (Minimum Safe Altitude Warning) alerts for tracks if ALL of the following conditions are met:
• The MSAW system status is equal to OPERATIONAL, and
• The track altitude is below the MSA (Minimum Safe Altitude) threshold defined for the current sector, and
• The track is in APPROACH or DEPARTURE flight phase, and
• The track vertical speed indicates descent or level flight (not climbing above VSP: MIN_CLIMB_RATE), and
• The track is located within a monitored airspace zone where MSAW is active, and
• The track has valid altitude data with quality indicator equal to HIGH or MEDIUM, and
• The flag MSAW_EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE is set to false or the track's transponder squawk code is NOT in the emergency range (7500, 7600, 7700).

SKYRADAR-RVSM-033: Generation of RVSM Non-Approval Alerts
SSS: ATCS-SSS-REQ-006500
Derived status partially
Derived rationale RVSM compliance monitoring for flight operations in reduced vertical separation airspace
Safety impact true
Verification method Test
Verification level RL
(SDS rules HLR_12) [cmats_snp] Partial derivation shall be avoided
SKYRADAR shall generate RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum) Non-Approval alerts for tracks if ALL of the following conditions are met:
• The RVSM monitoring system status is equal to OPERATIONAL, and
• The track flight level is within RVSM airspace range (between CSP: RVSM_MIN_FL and CSP: RVSM_MAX_FL), and
• The track RVSM approval status indicator is set to NOT_APPROVED or UNKNOWN, and
• The track altitude source quality indicator is equal to HIGH or MEDIUM, and
• The track is located within an RVSM designated airspace zone where monitoring is active, and
• The track flight plan indicates IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) operation, and
• The flag RVSM_EMERGENCY_EXCEPTION is set to false or the track's transponder squawk code is NOT in the emergency range (7500, 7600, 7700).
